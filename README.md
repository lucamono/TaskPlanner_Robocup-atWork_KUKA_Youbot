# TaskPlanner_Robocup-Work_KUKA_Youbot

RoboCup@Work is a competition in RoboCup that targets the use of robots in work-related scenarios. It aims
to foster research and development that enables use of innovative mobile robots equipped with advanced
manipulators for current and future industrial applications, where robots cooperate with human workers for
complex tasks ranging from manufacturing, automation, and parts handling up to general logistics. The value of
classical task planning in soccer and rescue leagues is rather limited; if it used at all, these planners have to deal
with constraints that are quite different from those in most industrial domains. Task planning may eventually be of
great interest in RoboCup@Home, but so far most teams work with preprogrammed scripts or state machines
executing routine activities. In RoboCup@Work, however, multiagent planning and scheduling with multi-criteria
optimization is of immediate interest, and has a large potential for innovative applications. In this project we will
see a task planning approach based on a topological plan with focus on all the replanification in case of obstacles
during the navigation.

All the code are tested on Ubuntu 16.04 with Ros Kinetic
